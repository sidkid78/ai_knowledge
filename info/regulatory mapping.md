# Regulatory Mapping in the Universal Knowledge Graph (UKG)

Based on the provided sources, Regulatory Mapping is a core functionality within the Universal Knowledge Graph (UKG) framework designed to understand, track, and connect regulations, standards, policies, and legal provisions across different domains, jurisdictions, and hierarchical levels. It serves as the mechanism to ensure that knowledge, processes, and operations within the system are compliant with relevant rules and standards.

Regulatory Mapping is not a single, monolithic process but rather a multi-layered capability enabled by specific axes and components of the UKG's architecture.

## Key Components and Aspects

### 1. Comprehensive Regulation Mapping

The foundational layer involves mapping regulations across different levels of governance:

- **Federal regulations**: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
- **State regulations**: California DGS, New York OGS
- **Local procurement laws**
- **Special regulatory frameworks**: School Districts, Water Districts

This comprehensive mapping provides the raw data for regulatory connections.

### 2. Spiderweb Nodes (Axis 6)

Also known as the Spiderweb Regulation Link or Spiderweb Provision Layer, this axis is crucial for:

- Dynamic regulatory relationship mappings
- Central hub for interconnected regulatory compliance and policy mapping
- Mapping relationships between detailed concepts, standards, and compliance provisions
- Operating at provision-level detail
- Linking rules, standards, roles, and responsibilities within and across Pillar Levels
- Managing regulatory connections between different knowledge components
- Identifying missing or conflicting compliance provisions

The system uses a hierarchical branch system (Axis 3) to map provisions, policies, and compliance across domains. The mathematical formula associated with Spiderweb Nodes is given as:

- SW(x) = Σ(sᵢ ⋅ rᵢ) or SW(x₆)

### 3. Octopus Nodes (Axis 7)

Also known as the Octopus Expert Network or Octopus Node Regulatory Mapping, this axis:

- Identifies broader sector-specific regulatory frameworks
- Maps overarching knowledge domains that intersect with multiple Pillar Levels
- Handles impact analysis and relationship mapping across multiple dimensions
- Connects high-level regulatory frameworks with specific knowledge domains
- Represents overarching regulatory bodies and rule families (e.g., EPA, IEEE, WHO, SBA)
- Functions as cross-sector knowledge fusion nodes in the Unified System

The mathematical formula for Axis 7 is:

- ON(x₇) = ∫(δs/δt)dt

### 4. Honeycomb Nodes (Axis 5)

While primarily facilitating cross-pillar linkages and domain-to-domain crosswalks, Honeycomb Nodes also:

- Enable cross-referencing between regulations at different levels
- Create connections such as "FAR Part 7" to "Texas Regulation 2155" and "FAR Part 15" to "California Compliance"
- Work with Spiderweb Nodes to facilitate multi-directional navigation between interconnected regulations

### 5. Integration and Cross-Referencing

Regulatory Mapping is enhanced through the interplay of these nodes:

- **Spiderweb Nodes**: Provide clause-level linking and compliance pathways
- **Octopus Nodes**: Provide overarching regulatory context
- **Honeycomb Nodes**: Bridge different regulatory domains and levels

This integration allows the AI to simulate reading nested regulations, creating a dynamic web of relationships spanning across different pillars and levels.

### 6. Roles and Expertise Mapping

Regulatory Mapping is tied to specific roles and required expertise:

- The Spiderweb system maps compliance requirements to roles and responsibilities
- **Axis 10** identifies compliance experts and legal roles tied to specific regulatory clauses:
  - Regulatory Compliance Officer
  - Policy Enforcement Analyst
  - Legal Counsel
  - Standards Specialist
- **Axis 7** helps identify the Regulatory Expert
- **Axis 8** maps domain-specific expert roles based on Sublevel 2 within a Pillar

When a query involves regulations, Axis 6 detects the relevant Spiderweb Node, and Axis 10 identifies the applicable expert roles, simulating expert knowledge for provision-specific interpretation.

### 7. Compliance Validation and Gap Detection

A key purpose of Regulatory Mapping is enabling compliance validation and risk management:

- The UKG performs real-time compliance validation against regulations like FAR and DFARS
- **Regulatory Compliance Evaluation formula**: R_C(x) = Σ(rᵢ * cᵢ * vᵢ)
- **Compliance Gap Detection**: CGD(x) = Δ(Rc_expected - Rc_actual)
- Spiderweb Nodes aid in identifying missing or conflicting compliance provisions

### 8. Integration with Location (Axis 12)

While the system defaults to the U.S. location base:

- Regulatory mapping implicitly considers location
- Regulations and compliance standards often vary by location
- Specialized nodes consider geospatial context for accurately applying relevant regulations

## Summary

In essence, Regulatory Mapping within the UKG provides a structured, interconnected, and dynamic representation of the regulatory landscape. It allows the system to understand the relationships between different rules, standards, and policies at various levels of detail, link them to specific domains and roles, and use this understanding to perform critical functions like compliance validation, risk assessment, and expert simulation.

## Mathematical Representations for Regulatory Mapping

The sources provide specific mathematical representations for both the Spiderweb Node system (Axis 6) and the Octopus Node system (Axis 7), highlighting how the UKG approaches regulatory mapping and related analyses quantitatively.

### Axis 6: Spiderweb Node (SW(x) / SW(x₆)) Mathematical Formula

The mathematical formula for the Spiderweb Node axis is explicitly given as: 

**SW(x) = Σ(sᵢ ⋅ rᵢ)**

This formula is also referred to as SW(x₆).

According to the sources:

- **(sᵢ)** denotes provision identifiers. These identifiers could represent regulatory clauses, standards, ethical guidelines, or other structured knowledge standards.
- **(rᵢ)** represents their regulatory relevance or role implications. The sources also define this as regulatory linkage strength or role relevance or provision-expert influence summation.

The formula is described as representing role-weighted regulatory crosslinks.

In essence, the Spiderweb Node system, through this summation formula, quantitatively assesses the cumulative impact or relevance of specific regulatory provisions (sᵢ) based on their linkage strength or implications for roles and regulations (rᵢ) within the network. This axis is responsible for mapping regulatory compliance and provisions across all 87 Pillar Levels. It crosslinks compliance standards, legal frameworks, ethical guidelines, and other structured knowledge standards to relevant roles and knowledge domains.

The Spiderweb nodes operate at a provision-level detail, mapping how rules, standards, roles, and responsibilities relate within and across Pillar Levels. They aid specifically in identifying missing or potentially conflicting compliance provisions across different regulatory frameworks or jurisdictions.

### Axis 7: Octopus Node (ON(x₇)) Mathematical Formula

The mathematical formula associated with Axis 7 (Octopus Nodes) is given as: 

**ON(x₇) = ∫(δs/δt)dt**

This formula is described as representing the sectoral change of scope over time or the integration of sectoral data density over time.

Octopus Nodes identify broader sector-specific regulatory frameworks and overarching knowledge domains. They handle impact analysis and relationship mapping across multiple dimensions. This is crucial for:

1. Uncovering gaps in regulatory alignment
2. Understanding the broader implications of knowledge within a specific domain
3. Identifying unintended consequences

The integral form of the formula suggests a quantitative evaluation of how these regulatory landscapes or knowledge domains evolve or change over time across sectors.

Octopus Nodes often intersect with multiple Pillar Levels and work alongside the Spiderweb pattern to manage complex regulatory relationships and impact assessment. In the context of the Unified System, Octopus Nodes are repurposed as cross-sector knowledge fusion nodes.

### Contribution to Regulatory Mapping and Risk Assessment

Together, these formulas and the systems they represent form the core quantitative basis for regulatory mapping and risk assessment:

1. **Provision-Level Detail (Axis 6)**: The SW(x) formula quantifies the relevance and interconnectedness of specific regulatory clauses or standards (sᵢ) based on their linkage strengths (rᵢ). This allows the system to build a detailed, weighted map of regulatory requirements at a granular level across all domains.

2. **Overarching Context and Impact (Axis 7)**: The ON(x₇) formula, with its integration over time and focus on "sectoral change of scope", provides a quantitative means to assess the broader, evolving regulatory environment and its impact across sectors. This allows the UKG to understand high-level regulatory ecosystems and their dynamic nature.

3. **Compliance Validation and Gap Detection**: Regulatory mapping, enabled by Axis 6 and Axis 7, is crucial for compliance validation. The UKG performs real-time validation against regulations like FAR and DFARS. Spiderweb Nodes, by managing connections and relationships, specifically aid in identifying missing or conflicting compliance provisions, while Octopus Nodes are crucial for uncovering gaps in regulatory alignment across dimensions.

4. **Regulatory Risk Evaluation**: The mathematical models associated with Spiderweb Nodes enable a quantitative approach to assessing compliance risks and the impact of different legal provisions. The Risk Axis further quantifies regulatory risks, leveraging the linkage to regulations provided by Axis 6 and Axis 7. It can assess risk by evaluating the strength of these links (perhaps related to the rᵢ in the SW formula), the potential for non-compliance, and geographical context.

5. **Expert Simulation**: The Spiderweb Provision Mapping (Axis 6) helps identify the Compliance Expert by linking regulations to a query, while the Octopus Node Regulatory Mapping (Axis 7) helps identify the Regulatory Expert by simulating regulations through role-linked references. Axis 10 specifically maps expert interpretive roles extracted from Spiderweb branches.

In summary, the SW(x) formula for Axis 6 quantifies the relevance and interconnectedness of detailed regulatory provisions, forming the basis for granular compliance mapping. The ON(x₇) formula for Axis 7 provides a quantitative measure of the dynamic, multi-dimensional nature of broader regulatory frameworks and their cross-sectoral impact over time. These mathematical underpinnings allow the UKG to move beyond simple storage of regulations to a dynamic system capable of quantitative compliance validation, gap detection, risk assessment, and expert simulation within the regulatory landscape.
